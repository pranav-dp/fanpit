# Product Context

## Purpose
The Conversational Event Concierge aims to provide Fanpit users with a seamless, intuitive, and interactive way to discover, get information about, and book free events using natural language.

## Problems Solved
- **Information Overload:** Users often face a cluttered interface when searching for events. A conversational agent simplifies this by providing direct answers.
- **Complex Search:** Traditional search filters can be rigid. Natural language queries allow for more flexible and user-friendly searching (e.g., "what's happening this weekend?").
- **Fragmented Information:** Users have to navigate to different pages for event details, artist info, and brand info. The agent can consolidate this information in one conversation.
- **Booking Friction:** The booking process can be cumbersome. The agent aims to make booking a free event as simple as sending a message.

## How it Should Work
A user interacts with a chat interface on the Fanpit frontend. They can type queries in natural language. The AI agent, powered by LangGraph, interprets these queries and uses a set of tools to interact with the Fanpit backend. These tools will fetch event data, check availability, and perform bookings. The conversation should feel natural and context-aware.

## User Experience Goals
- **Effortless Discovery:** Users should feel like they are talking to a helpful concierge who understands their needs.
- **Conversational and Interactive:** The interaction should be a two-way dialogue, not just a simple command-response system.
- **Trustworthy and Reliable:** The information provided should be accurate and up-to-date. The booking process must be secure and reliable.
- **Fast and Responsive:** The agent should provide quick answers and confirmations.
